### Overview

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike  webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

### Summary

- The most popular start and end stations were located in Jersey City and Hoboken, New Jersey and there were notably more end stations than start stations located in Manhattan. This tells us that people seem to use Citi Bikes for either out-and-back trips from outside of NYC or trips from New Jersey to NYC but not back out.
- The top 9 most popular start and end stations are all the same and they are more often used by subscribed members. This may be because these are the most popular jumping-off points for tourists but it seems more likely that these subscribers are commuters that use the bikes to get to other popular stations and back.
- Average ride duration for casual users is more than 100% higher than duration for members. This is most likely because members use the bikes with a specific destination and timeline of use and casual riders or more often tourists without set agendas.
- Member rides are most concentrated on week day mornings and evenings, during times when people are commuting to work. Casual rides are more common on weekends between late morning and early afternoon. This is likely due to causal riders being mostly made up of tourist visiting the area on weekends. It should also be noted that even on weekends, during that same time frame, member riders make up the majority of total rides, showing that members do not use bikes solely for the suspected commuting.
